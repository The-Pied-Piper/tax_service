"""Snapshot of the `ca/` artifact kind identifiers, as the application registers them.

Identifiers are stored with results and exposed by the API, so changing or removing one is a
breaking change: update this snapshot only on purpose. Each package snapshots its own namespace;
declaring a kind in this package's catalog adds it here. The kinds are registered explicitly,
as the composition root does, into a fresh registry.
